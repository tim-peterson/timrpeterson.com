I'm a postdoc at Harvard in molecular biology. Starting next July (2016), I'm going to be an assistant professor in the department of medicine at Washington University St. Louis. I study genomics, metabolomics and the quantified self of aging and mental health. Currently, I'm working on an osteoporosis project.

I'm a founder at [Door of Clubs](https://www.doorofclubs.com/) and previously, Onarbor.
